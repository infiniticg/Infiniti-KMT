# Infiniti KMT

## INFINITI’S PROJECT APPROACH
The project approach was driven by a compressed schedule with two distinct tracks of requirements

  1.	Building working open-source software using an Agile/iterative approach based on the Digital Services Playbook.

  2.	Responding to the RFI’s administrative/Submission requirements

Our Agile Coach worked with the Product Manager to layout an Agile based project using Jira to track Sprints, backlog, user stories, and tasks.  All documentation was tracked in Confluence. All code and supporting artifacts were stored in GitHub.  Our approach included daily meetings to collaborate.  We also estimated work by resource in a [Workplan](<https://github.com/infiniticg/Infiniti-KMT/blob/master/Documentation/Infiniti_KMT_Prototype_Workplan.pdf>) so that we could gain commitment from the team members and communicate to their project managers to make sure they were available for the work.
  
To help our team make sure we were meeting the RFI’s requirements for this project we created a [requirements traceability matrix](<https://github.com/infiniticg/Infiniti-KMT/blob/master/Infiniti_Functional_and_Technical_Requirements.pdf>).

## INFINITI’S TECHNICAL APPROACH 
Infiniti’s technical approach is document in accordance with the instructions in the RFI.
We created a separate application document <LINK> which shows code flow from client UI, to JavaScript library, to REST service to database, pointing to code in the GitHub repository.

We also created a complete Machine Learning model using ????? 

We also modified a copy US Digital Services Playbook ???? to show how we followed the playbook.

Other elements of our technical approach were:

a)	Assigned one (1) leader and gave that person authority and responsibility and held that person accountable for the quality of the prototype submitted. Using the Digital Services Playbook - Play 6 as a guide, we identified Josh Petla (Josh is Infiniti’s Director of Cloud Services and has extensive agile development experience including in Knowledge Management) as our Product Manager.

b)	Assembled a multidisciplinary and collaborative team that includes, at a minimum, five (5) of the labor categories as identified in Attachment B: PQVP DS-AD Labor Category Descriptions:
  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Product Manager: Josh Petla
  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Technical Architect: Carlos Rivas
  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Full Stack Developer: Uday Katakam
  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Agile Coach: Dan Rousseau
  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;DevOps Engineer: Jason Tasker
  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Data Scientist: Ananth Gopalakrishnan
  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Data Scientist: Harsha Gopianandan
  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Interaction Designer/User Researcher/Usability Tester:	Brittney Scott

c)	Understood what people needed, by including people in the prototype development and design process; Using the Digital Services Playbook - Play 1 ???? as a guide, we worked with available resources as 'real' users as we developed user personas, user stories and performed user testing.    Given the theoretical nature of the project we decided to come up with a more tangible scenario by using a Tax Department as our client for the KMT.   This allowed the team to perform research interviews with former Tax Department employees to develop realistic personas and user stories.  Having realistic personas and user stories allowed our people to get into character for design and testing.

d)	Used at least a minimum of three (3) “user-centric design” techniques and/or tools: We used several (more than three use techniques) user centric design techniques:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;i.	 [Research Interviews](<https://github.com/infiniticg/Infiniti-KMT/blob/master/Documentation/Infiniti_User_Centric_Design_Process_Research_Interview.pdf>)

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ii.	  [User stories](<https://github.com/infiniticg/Infiniti-KMT/tree/master/Documentation/UserStories>)

 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;iii.	[Personas](<https://github.com/infiniticg/Infiniti-KMT/blob/master/Documentation/KMT%20Personas.pdf>)

 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;iv.	  Usability Testing <LINK>

Our user centric design approach started with Research Interviews which were one-on-one sessions with users. These were a fundamental component of our use-centric design process. By engaging with former auditors, program specialists, and protest hearing specialist we conceived of and designed the KMT portal, focusing on the most important outcomes.

Our team interviewed Scott Sanders (former auditor, program specialist, and hearing officer) and John Gray (architect of Tax Audit systems and Tax Collection systems).  Scott stepped the team through the workflow of audits and protests and explaining how knowledge articles and knowledge management would be beneficial within this process.  We recorded a photo of Scott [whiteboarding the workflow](<https://github.com/infiniticg/Infiniti-KMT/blob/master/Documentation/Infiniti_User_Centric_Design_Process_Research_Interview.pdf>).
Also shown in the photo is Brittney Scott who is the “Writer/Content Designer/Content Strategist” and led the research and development of interactive and storytelling for the project.
Our team then worked with our people to develop [personas and user stories](<https://github.com/infiniticg/Infiniti-KMT/tree/master/Documentation/UserStories>).  Our Agile Coach reviewed the user stories and provided input on acceptance criteria and other aspects of these artifacts to strengthen them.

e)	Used GitHub to document code commits;  Infiniti’s developers and DevOps engineer used GitHub throughout the project for code commits.
 
f)	Used Swagger to document the RESTful API, and provided a link to the Swagger API;????

g)	Complied with Section 508 of the Americans with Disabilities Act and WCAG 2.0; We completed overall accessible testing to meet Section 508 of the Americans with Disabilities Act and WCAG 2.0.  We made corrections as necessary to be section 508 compliant. ?????

h)	Created or used a design style guide and/or a pattern library; We created and used a design style guide.  ?????

i)	Performed usability tests ???? with people; Our focus was to identify 'real' users that we associated with our personas to make sure we could follow user stories to completion.  

j)	Used an iterative approach, where feedback informed subsequent work or versions of the prototype; Given the very short timeframe our approach was to quickly move through multiple, short sprints.  The first sprint was completed in eight days and provided a minimum viable product (MVP).  We then conducted two additional sprints to add the remaining functionality.

The iterative development approach was part of our Agile methodology guided by our Agile Coach:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;i.	At the beginning of the project, the team set up the facilities including the collaborative work area, selected the tools (Jira and Confluence)

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ii.	Set up team collaboration site in Jira with the product backlog used to guide the development team

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;iii.	Periodically product owner and development team groomed product backlog 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;iv.	At the beginning of each sprint, we identified the sprint goal and the sprint backlog during sprint planning meeting

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;v.	Held daily scrum meetings at the same time and place reviewing the tasks

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;vi.	Our Sprint Demos served allowed us to gather feedback from Product Owner and proxy users based on personas.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;vii.	Sprint Retrospectives to help course correct the process

The evidence of our team's Agile process is documented within GitHub and includes [screen shots of Jira](<https://github.com/infiniticg/Infiniti-KMT/blob/master/Documentation/Infiniti_KMT_Agile_Process.pdf>) as well as other more traditional documentation.


k)	Created a prototype that works on multiple devices, and presents a responsive design;??????????

l)	Used at least five (5) modern and open-source technologies, regardless of architectural layer (frontend, backend, etc.);  By using the Infiniti team’s extensive experience with open-source tools, and in alignment with the Digital Services Playbook goal was to "default to open (play 13)", we were able to integrate many open-source tools into our prototype, including:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;i.	As with any project we undertake we look for the best components to integrate, and reused, rather than build from scratch.  However, we also look for components that are widely used, with a proven track record of success.  As such, the Infiniti KMT prototype uses Equella which is an open source Knowledge Management system as the framework for our KMT.  Equella is widely used in the Education sector and Infiniti staff have been involved in the development and implementation of Equella.  

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ii.	Node.js (https://nodejs.org/en/) which is an open-source, cross-platform JavaScript run-time environment for executing JavaScript code server-side

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;iii.	Facebook React (a.k.a. ReactJS) (https://reactjs.org/) - React allows developers to create large web-applications that use data and can change over time without reloading the page. It aims primarily to provide speed, simplicity, and scalability.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;iv.	Flux Dispatcher (https://facebook.github.io/flux/docs/dispatcher.html)

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;v.	ImageMagick which is a free and open-source software suite for displaying, converting, and editing raster image and vector image files.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;vi.	Libav Open source audio and video processing tools.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;vii.	The prototype database is Postgres which is an open source database.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;viii.	Apache Tomcat is used as the application server.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ix.	Jenkins is used to kick off the build process.

m)	Deployed the prototype on an Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) or Platform as Service (PaaS) provider, and indicated which provider they used; The Infiniti KMT Prototype use AWS IaaS and PaaS.  Infiniti is an AWS Advanced Partner with a large team of AWS architects and engineers.  We are probably the largest AWS Public Sector consulting company in California.  Our AWS DevOps engineer setup a leading-edge AWS IaaS and PaaS environment for the Infiniti KMT prototype.  This AWS environment includes the following components

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;i.	AWS Elastic Container Service (ECS) - ECS is a highly scalable, high-performance container orchestration service that supports Docker containers and allows you to easily run and scale containerized applications on AWS

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ii.	Amazon Elastic Container Registry (ECR) – ECR  is a fully-managed Docker container registry that makes it easy for developers to store, manage, and deploy Docker container images. ECR is integrated with AWS ECS, simplifying the development to production workflow. Amazon ECR eliminates the need to operate your own container repositories or worry about scaling the underlying infrastructure.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;iii.	AWS Relational Database Service (RDS) – RDS, as a PaaS, makes it easy to set up, operate, and scale a relational database in the cloud. RDS provides cost-efficient and resizable capacity while automating time-consuming administration tasks such as hardware provisioning, database setup, patching and backups.   For the KMT prototype we chose RDS Postgres which is an open source database.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;iv.	New Relic Agent is deployed in AWS ECS to monitor application health and performance.  Infiniti is a partner with NewRelic and has implemented NewRelic in many large environments.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;v.	Audit trail logs are saved into an AWS S3 bucket in a master account, away from the deployment account, for safe keeping.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;vi.	Resilience is provided by an auto-scaling group managed by ECS and a Multi-AZ DB Deployment that is also backed up regularly.

Architectural diagrams for our AWS IaaS and PaaS environment are included in our application architecture document ????

n)	Developed automated unit tests for their code;  Infiniti’s Developers used automated unit tests for the KMT code.  Our DevOps engineer then automated the running of the unit tests into the CI/CD pipeline.

o)	Setup or used a continuous integration system to automate the running of tests and continuously deployed their code to their IaaS or PaaS provider;  Infiniti’s DevOps engineer set up a sophisticated and highly automated CI/CD pipeline for the KMT prototype including:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;i.	When a build is triggered, Jenkins downloads the source files from the GitHub repository.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ii.	Tests are automatically run

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;iii.	When the build completes the resulting artifact is a Docker Image.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;iv.	This Docker image is pushed to AWS ECR (Container Registry) and later pushed to AWS ECS (Elastic Container Service) for Deployment

Architectural diagrams for our CI/CD pipeline is included in our application architecture document <LINK>

p)	Setup or used configuration management; Infiniti’s DevOps engineer setup a GitHub for the Infiniti KMT prototype.  All source code and supporting artifacts are maintained under configuration management in GitHub.  

q)	Setup or used continuous monitoring; To provide sophisticated continuous monitoring Infiniti’s DevOps engineer deployed a New Relic Agent in AWS ECS to monitor application health and performance.  Infiniti is a partner with NewRelic and has implemented NewRelic in many large environments.

r)	Deployed their software in an open source container, such as Docker (i.e., utilized operating-system-level virtualization); Infiniti’s DevOps engineer containerized the Infiniti KMT prototype into Docker.  This Docker container is built by the Jenkins build as part of the CI/CD pipeline.

s)	Provided sufficient documentation to install and run their prototype on another machine; Infiniti’s DevOps engineer documented the install and run procedures into Install Instructions ?????

t)	Prototype and underlying platforms used to create and run the prototype are openly licensed and free of charge.  Infiniti’s team used all open source technologies to build the Infiniti KMT prototype and have deployed to an AWS environment that is free of charge.
