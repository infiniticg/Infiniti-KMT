## INFINITI’S PROJECT APPROACH
The project approach was driven by a compressed schedule with two distinct tracks of requirements

  1.	Building working open-source software using an Agile/iterative approach based on the Digital Services Playbook.

  2.	Responding to the RFI’s administrative/Submission requirements

Our Agile Coach worked with the Product Manager to layout an Agile based project using Jira to track Sprints, backlog, user stories, and tasks.  All documentation was tracked in Confluence. All code and supporting artifacts were stored in GitHub.  Our approach included daily meetings to collaborate.  We also estimated work by resource in a [Workplan](<https://github.com/infiniticg/Infiniti-KMT/blob/master/Documentation/Infiniti_KMT_Prototype_Workplan.pdf>) so that we could gain commitment from the team members and communicate to their project managers to make sure they were available for the work.
  
To help our team make sure we were meeting the RFI’s requirements for this project we created a [requirements traceability matrix](<https://github.com/infiniticg/Infiniti-KMT/blob/master/Infiniti_Functional_and_Technical_Requirements.pdf>).

## INFINITI’S TECHNICAL APPROACH 
Infiniti’s technical approach is document in accordance with the instructions in the RFI.
We created a separate application document <LINK> which shows code flow from client UI, to JavaScript library, to REST service to database, pointing to code in the GitHub repository.

We also created a complete Machine Learning model using ????? 

We also modified a copy US Digital Services Playbook ???? to show how we followed the playbook.

Other elements of our technical approach were:

a)	Assigned one (1) leader and gave that person authority and responsibility and held that person accountable for the quality of the prototype submitted. Using the Digital Services Playbook - Play 6 as a guide, we identified Josh Petla (Josh is Infiniti’s Director of Cloud Services and has extensive agile development experience including in Knowledge Management) as our Product Manager.

b)	Assembled a multidisciplinary and collaborative team that includes, at a minimum, five (5) of the labor categories as identified in Attachment B: PQVP DS-AD Labor Category Descriptions:
  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Product Manager: Josh Petla
  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Technical Architect: Carlos Rivas
  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Full Stack Developer: Uday Katakam
  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Agile Coach: Dan Rousseau
  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;DevOps Engineer: Jason Tasker
  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Data Scientist: Ananth Gopalakrishnan
  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Data Scientist: Harsha Gopianandan
  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Interaction Designer/User Researcher/Usability Tester:	Brittney Scott

c)	Understood what people needed, by including people in the prototype development and design process; Using the Digital Services Playbook - Play 1 ???? as a guide, we worked with available resources as 'real' users as we developed user personas, user stories and performed user testing.    Given the theoretical nature of the project we decided to come up with a more tangible scenario by using a Tax Department as our client for the KMT.   This allowed the team to perform research interviews with former Tax Department employees to develop realistic personas and user stories.  Having realistic personas and user stories allowed our people to get into character for design and testing.

d)	Used at least a minimum of three (3) “user-centric design” techniques and/or tools: We used several (more than three use techniques) user centric design techniques:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;i.	 [Research Interviews](<https://github.com/infiniticg/Infiniti-KMT/blob/master/Documentation/Infiniti_User_Centric_Design_Process_Research_Interview.pdf>)

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ii.	  [User stories](<https://github.com/infiniticg/Infiniti-KMT/tree/master/Documentation/UserStories>)

 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;iii.	[Personas](<https://github.com/infiniticg/Infiniti-KMT/blob/master/Documentation/KMT%20Personas.pdf>)

 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;iv.	  Usability Testing <LINK>

Our user centric design approach started with Research Interviews which were one-on-one sessions with users. These were a fundamental component of our use-centric design process. By engaging with former auditors, program specialists, and protest hearing specialist we conceived of and designed the KMT portal, focusing on the most important outcomes.

Our team interviewed Scott Sanders (former auditor, program specialist, and hearing officer) and John Gray (architect of Tax Audit systems and Tax Collection systems).  Scott stepped the team through the workflow of audits and protests and explaining how knowledge articles and knowledge management would be beneficial within this process.  We recorded a photo of Scott [whiteboarding the workflow](<https://github.com/infiniticg/Infiniti-KMT/blob/master/Documentation/Infiniti_User_Centric_Design_Process_Research_Interview.pdf>).
Also shown in the photo is Brittney Scott who is the “Writer/Content Designer/Content Strategist” and led the research and development of interactive and storytelling for the project.
Our team then worked with our people to develop [personas and user stories](<https://github.com/infiniticg/Infiniti-KMT/tree/master/Documentation/UserStories>).  Our Agile Coach reviewed the user stories and provided input on acceptance criteria and other aspects of these artifacts to strengthen them.

e)	Used GitHub to document code commits;  Infiniti’s developers and DevOps engineer used GitHub throughout the project for code commits.
 
f)	Used Swagger to document the RESTful API, and provided a link to the Swagger API;????

g)	Complied with Section 508 of the Americans with Disabilities Act and WCAG 2.0; We completed overall accessible testing to meet Section 508 of the Americans with Disabilities Act and WCAG 2.0.  We made corrections as necessary to be section 508 compliant. ?????

h)	Created or used a design style guide and/or a pattern library; We created and used a design style guide.  ?????


i)	Performed usability tests ???? with people; Our focus was to identify 'real' users that we associated with our personas to make sure we could follow user stories to completion.  

j)	Used an iterative approach, where feedback informed subsequent work or versions of the prototype; Given the very short timeframe our approach was to quickly move through multiple, short sprints.  The first sprint was completed in eight days and provided a minimum viable product (MVP).  We then conducted two additional sprints to add the remaining functionality.

The iterative development approach was part of our Agile methodology guided by our Agile Coach:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;i.	At the beginning of the project, the team set up the facilities including the collaborative work area, selected the tools (Jira and Confluence)

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ii.	Set up team collaboration site in Jira with the product backlog used to guide the development team

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;iii.	Periodically product owner and development team groomed product backlog 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;iv.	At the beginning of each sprint, we identified the sprint goal and the sprint backlog during sprint planning meeting

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;v.	Held daily scrum meetings at the same time and place reviewing the tasks

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;vi.	Our Sprint Demos served allowed us to gather feedback from Product Owner and proxy users based on personas.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;vii.	Sprint Retrospectives to help course correct the process

The evidence of our team's Agile process is documented within GitHub and includes [screen shots of Jira](<https://github.com/infiniticg/Infiniti-KMT/blob/master/Documentation/Infiniti_KMT_Agile_Process.pdf>) as well as other more traditional documentation.
