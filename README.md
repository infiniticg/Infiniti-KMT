## INFINITI’S PROJECT APPROACH
The project approach was driven by a compressed schedule with two distinct tracks of requirements

  1.	Building working open-source software using an Agile/iterative approach based on the Digital Services Playbook.

  2.	Responding to the RFI’s administrative/Submission requirements

Our Agile Coach worked with the Product Manager to layout an Agile based project using Jira to track Sprints, backlog, user stories, and tasks.  All documentation was tracked in Confluence. All code and supporting artifacts were stored in GitHub.  Our approach included daily meetings to collaborate.  We also estimated work by resource in a [Workplan](<https://github.com/infiniticg/Infiniti-KMT/blob/master/Documentation/Infiniti_KMT_Prototype_Workplan.pdf>) so that we could gain commitment from the team members and communicate to their project managers to make sure they were available for the work.
  
To help our team make sure we were meeting the RFI’s requirements for this project we created a [requirements traceability matrix](<https://github.com/infiniticg/Infiniti-KMT/blob/master/Infiniti_Functional_and_Technical_Requirements.pdf>).



d)	Used at least a minimum of three (3) “user-centric design” techniques and/or tools: We used several (more than three use techniques) user centric design techniques:

  i.	 [Research Interviews](<https://github.com/infiniticg/Infiniti-KMT/blob/master/Documentation/Infiniti_User_Centric_Design_Process_Research_Interview.pdf>)

  ii.	  [User stories](<https://github.com/infiniticg/Infiniti-KMT/tree/master/Documentation/UserStories>)

  iii.	[Personas](<https://github.com/infiniticg/Infiniti-KMT/blob/master/Documentation/KMT%20Personas.pdf>)

  iv.	  Usability Testing <LINK>
