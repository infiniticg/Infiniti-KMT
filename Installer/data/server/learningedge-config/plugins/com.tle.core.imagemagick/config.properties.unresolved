# ImageMagick is a set of different programs, and EQUELLA needs to know the directory that
# contains these programs.  For example, running 'which convert' on a unix-like system may
# return '/usr/bin/convert' so you should enter '/usr/bin'.  On a Windows system, you may
# have installed to 'C:\ImageMagick6.4', then the programs can be found directly inside that
# path.

imageMagick.path = ${imagemagick/path#t\/}
