# Lines beginning with # are ignored, as are blank lines.
# Otherwise meaningful linecontent is in 3 parts, value name extra.
# value is akey, a simple integer, whichis used internally by flickr, and so
# is the value that EQUELLA sets in a search filter sent to the flickr API,
# and is the raw value returned in a result set from Flickr.
# THe name is a licence descriptors which is assumed by EQUELLA to be recognisable
# by EQUELLA users and is thus the displayed value of selectable filter options.
# The remainder AFTER the the first 2 space-separated strings (ie, the 'extra')
# is available as a plain-language rendition of the licence type, for example
# rendered as a hover-over alt (tag:'title') text.
#
# Where not-for-display is the 'name' value, the licence type will not appear as a
# selectable filter value.
#
#
# In the event flickr has absolutely no licence information for an item returned
# in a result set, we have this placeholder:

no-data not-for-display No licence restriction recorded

# The order is the order of the rendered list, and is the order given in  wikipedia
# (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creative_Commons_licenses).
# The given order is presumed to ascend in severity.
#
# The top value (7) is a feature of certain photos held by Flickr Common Institutions. It would
# seem the average flickr user doesn't have the option of setting this for their photos.
# Flickr default (0) is to reserve rights (a photo's licence attribute is integer value zero)
