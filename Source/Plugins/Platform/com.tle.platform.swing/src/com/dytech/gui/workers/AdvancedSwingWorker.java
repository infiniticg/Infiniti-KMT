/**
 * This is a rehash of the well-known SwingWorker, in order to make it easier to
 * use, and allow for better customisation by SwingWorkers extending this. This
 * is fully backwards compatible with the standard SwingWorker, but also allows
 * the user to override <code>exception()</code>. This is called if
 * <code>construct</code> throws an exception. Also, developers wishing to offer
 * customised versions of SwingWorker can override any of the following events:
 * <ul>
 * <li><code>beforeConstruct()</code></li>
 * <li><code>afterConstruct()</code></li>
 * <li><code>beforeFinished()</code></li>
 * <li><code>afterFinished()</code></li>
 * <li><code>beforeException()</code></li>
 * <li><code>afterException()</code></li>
 * </ul>
 * A good example of this is <code>GlassSwingWorker</code>. The original
 * SwingWorker Javadoc is as follows...
 * <hr/>
 * This is the 3rd version of SwingWorker (also known as SwingWorker 3), an
 * abstract class that you subclass to perform GUI-related work in a dedicated
 * thread. For instructions on using this class, see:
 * http://java.sun.com/docs/books/tutorial/uiswing/misc/threads.html Note that
 * the API changed slightly in the 3rd version: You must now invoke start() on
 * the SwingWorker after creating it.
