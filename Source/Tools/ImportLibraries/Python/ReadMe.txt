The Python SOAP webservice libraries allow easy access to TLE functionality, without the bother of implementing webservices support yourself.

Please refer to sample.py for example usage.

Python 2.4 or later is required, this can be downloaded from http://www.python.org/
To use the ODBC library, you will also need the Win32 extensions for Python.
