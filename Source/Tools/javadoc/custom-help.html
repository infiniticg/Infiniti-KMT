[%%//%%]======================================================================
[%%//%%] Prototype for custom user-created help file for the documentation
[%%//%%] generated using KtsDoclet (and javadoc tool).
[%%//%%]======================================================================
[%%//%%]
[%%//%%] The lines which have [%%//%%] ANYWHERE in the line are comment 
[%%//%%] lines for the KtsDoclet, they will be removed from this file
[%%//%%] before it is written into the documentation directory. The first
[%%//%%] line is designed to show some info if this file is opened directly
[%%//%%] in the browser (that shouldn't be done), it'll be removed in the final file.
[%%//%%]
[%%//%%] This prototype can be used to create custom help file for the
[%%//%%] generated documentation. When custom help is created using this
[%%//%%] prototype, it will have all the same standard decorations as
[%%//%%] all pages in the documentation, including top navigation bar,
[%%//%%] and other.
[%%//%%]
[%%//%%] All lines which have KtsDoclet templates which look like:
[%%//%%] 
[%%//%%]         [%%some-name%%]
[%%//%%] 
[%%//%%] AS WELL AS SURROUNDING LINES must be preserved and not altered
[%%//%%] in any way. These templates are used by internal, proprietary
[%%//%%] templates mechanism used by KtsDoclet to generate output HTML
[%%//%%] pages. KtsDoclet does not document or expose its templates mechanism.
[%%//%%] Templates are only exposed in this file in order to allow you
[%%//%%] create custom help file which will have the same look and
[%%//%%] functionality (top navigation bar etc) as all other documentation
[%%//%%] pages. If you use this prototype, you can enter any HTML text
[%%//%%] in the designted places documented below via comment
[%%//%%] lines, however you must not change any of the template lines.
[%%//%%]
[%%//%%] ALTERING TEMPLATE LINES WILL LEAD TO UNPREDICTABLE RESULTS.       
[%%//%%] COMMENT LINES BELOW SPECIFY WHERE USER LINES CAN BE ADDED.
[%%//%%] 
[%%//%%] When enterinig user text as designated below, you can remove 
[%%//%%] the comment lines saying "you can add text here", or you can
[%%//%%] leave them in this file so it'll be easier in the future to see
[%%//%%] where your text was added. Keep in mind all lines with [%%//%%] 
[%%//%%] are removed and never appear in the resulting HTML file.
[%%//%%]
[%%//%%]
[%%//%%] This file will be placed into the root output directory of the
[%%//%%] generated documentation. You can also provide a link, if necessary,
[%%//%%] to the original help file via <A HREF="doc-help.html">.
[%%//%%]
[%%//%%] You can rename this file to any name except it cannot be named
[%%//%%] "doc-help.html".
