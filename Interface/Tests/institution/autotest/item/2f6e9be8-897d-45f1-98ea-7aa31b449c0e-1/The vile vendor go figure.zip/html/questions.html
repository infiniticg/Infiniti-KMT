<h1>Likelihood questions</h1>
<p>There are many events that we can describe the probability of.  Try to use the words we have been talking about (certain, likely, equal chance, unlikely, certainly not).  Here are a few for you to think about:</p>

<p>How likely is it that you will receive a letter in the mail today?</p>
<p>How likely is it that you could beat your best friend in a race?</p>
<p>If you toss a coin, how likely is it to come up heads?</p>
<p>How likely is it that you will watch TV tonight?</p>
<p>How likely is it that you will have potatoes for dinner tonight?</p>
<p>If you roll a die, how likely is it that you will roll a 6?</p>
<p>How likely is it that you will go to school tomorrow?</p>


<p>Do you think your answers to all these questions would be the same as the answers a friend would give?  Maybe you could discuss with a friend what answers they would give.  Do you agree about how likely it is that each of you would win a race against each other?</p>
