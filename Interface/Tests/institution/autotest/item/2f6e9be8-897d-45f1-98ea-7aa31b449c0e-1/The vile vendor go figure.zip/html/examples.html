<h1>Your likelihood examples</h1>
<p>Now you try to think of some examples:</p>

<p>What are some things that are likely to happen tomorrow?<br />
Remember, if it is likely, then it will probably happen, but you don't know for sure.</p>

<p>What are some things that are unlikely to happen tomorrow?<br />
Remember, if it is unlikely, then it probably will not happen, but you don't know for sure.</p>

<p>What are some things that are certain to happen tomorrow?<br />
Remember, if it is certain to happen, then you know for sure that it will happen.</p>

<p>What are some things that will certainly not happen tomorrow?<br />
Remember, if it will certainly not happen, then you know for sure that it will not happen.</p>

<p>What are some things that have an equal chance of happening tomorrow?<br />
Remember, if it has an equal chance of happening, then it is just as likely to happen as it is not to happen.</p>
