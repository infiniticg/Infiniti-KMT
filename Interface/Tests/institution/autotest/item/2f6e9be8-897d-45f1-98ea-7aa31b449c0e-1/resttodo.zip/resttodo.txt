What is the meaning of VIEW_ITEM? You can see metadata/attachments from a search if you have DISCOVER_ITEM.


Testing

scorm package




Editing

When do bad urls get checked?
When do md5/thumbnails get generated.
We probably need a fixup to refresh/md5/thumbnail from filesystem. Already have one?
Permission checking - EDIT_ITEM,MOVE_ITEM,CHANGE_OWNERSHIP

Make sure navigation nodes are checked for attachment linkage.
Refs to remove the need for client to make new UUIDs.
Test changing type of attachment but not changing uuid.
Redmine like stale data checking
File based attachment field stuff.
