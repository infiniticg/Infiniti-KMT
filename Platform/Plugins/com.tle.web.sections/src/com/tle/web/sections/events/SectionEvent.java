/**
 * An event that is to be processed by <code>EventListener</code>s.
 * <p>
 * There are three different types of <code>SectionEvent</code>s.
 * <ul>
 * <li>Broadcast - These are events which are broadcast to listeners registered
 * with a target id of <code>null</code>. Examples are:
 * <ul>
 * <li>{@link ParametersEvent}</li>
 * <li>{@link BookmarkEvent}</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p></li>
 * <li>Targeted<br>
 * These are events which are directed towards are particular
 * {@link com.tle.web.sections.Section}. <br>
 * A good example is the {@link RenderEvent}.
 * <p></li>
 * <li>Direct - These events don't have a listener list, they are just fired
 * directly via {@link #fireDirect(SectionId, SectionInfo)}. <br>
 * An example is the
 * {@link com.tle.web.sections.registry.handler.AnnotatedEventsScanner.DirectMethodEvent}.
 * <p></li>
 * </ul>
 * The {@link SectionInfo} object is responsible for maintaining a priority
 * queue of <code>SectionEvent</code>s. The queue can be bypassed by directly
 * calling {@link SectionInfo#processEvent(SectionEvent)}, which is generally
 * the case for Broadcast and Targeted events.
